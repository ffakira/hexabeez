## HexaBeez

Creating a RESTful API with the usage of Express and Vue. Currently just finished
the mock-up interface, and started working slowly towards the backend.

Auth, will be done via `jwt`, as I have intention in keeping everything as SPA. The
website itself is currently serving only static files, however this is about to change
quite soon.

This pet project, is mainly for learning Vue framework itself more in-depth on how the API
works. Please note this is not the final version of the project.
